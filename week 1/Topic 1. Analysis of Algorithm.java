#What is TC?
 TC is not the time taken by the machine, instead it is the function that gives us a reltioanship about how the time will grow as the input grows.
 Same algo can take different timee in different machine.

#What do we need to consider when thining of TC.
 1. Always look for the worst case complexity.
 2. Always look for complexity for larger number.
 3. We ignore the constant.
 4. We ignore the less domntating term.
 
#Big O notation
 It is an upper bound of an algo. for ex if given Big O = N^3, means the graph/relationaship can not exceed N^3 . 
 it maybe solved in N, log n, N^2 but not abve given complexity
 
#Big Omega notation.
 It is the opposite of Big O
 It give lower bound of an algo
 Eg: given omega N^3 means algo will take min N^3 time or more than it 
 
#Big theta notation.
 See in textbook
 
#little o notation
 see in text
#little omega 
 see intext
 
#space compexity
 Input space + auxillary space
